Introduction/Overview:
We decided to remake Flappy Bird into a 3D version called “Floppy Cat” featuring the Nyan Cat. Similar to Flappy Bird, the goal of this game is to have Nyan Cat avoid obstacles as it flies through the sky. The game is endless, meaning a user cannot win, rather one attempts to beat their highest score. We plan to base the scoring on the number of successfully-passed obstacles.


User Interaction and Gameplay:

Key:Action
J: Jump
R: Restart
C: Change Color
F: Toggle First Person Mode


The game will initially load to Nyan Cat being in a frozen state. When a user is ready to play, they will press the Spacebar/J to start the game. Without input, Nyan Cat falls downward based on projectile motion (advanced feature), and when a user inputs a Jump, Nyan Cat will jump up. Over time, the game will incrementally speed up to become more challenging. If Nyan Cat hits a pipe or falls out of bounds, the game will terminate with a Game Over screen and the score will become final. Pressing the R key will restart the game and reset the current score to 0. If a user wants a change of scenery, they can press the C button to switch between different game modes we have configured. Additionally, if a user is looking for a challenge, they can enter First-Person-Mode where the camera is set inside the Nyan Cat. 

Technical Features: 
Floppy Cat will incorporate collision detection. As Nyan Cat travels, the player will have to avoid hitting pillars. The player will tap the spacebar/J to make the cat jump and get it through pillar gaps at various heights. Each pillar passed adds a point to the player’s score, and the game ends when the ball hits a pillar. 

Floppy Cat will also include physics-based falling. After jumping, Nyan Cat will adhere to projectile motion. The game will have a minimum bound for the Nyan Cat to allow the game to be terminated if the user fails to make it jump through the pipes.

First-Person-Mode will result in the camera being moved in a way that makes the player feel like they are the Nyan Cat. From the perspective of the cat, one will perform the same gameplay, but due to the lack of foresight, the task will be much more challenging!
